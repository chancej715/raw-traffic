# Raw Traffic
This is a simple program for capturing network traffic on an interface and saving it to a binary file using libpcap.

To make this program, I followed the [Programming With Pcap](https://www.tcpdump.org/pcap.html) guide.

## Dependencies
This program requires the libpcap development libraries. 

If you're on Debian, you can install these libraries via the following command: 
```
sudo apt-get install libpcap-dev
```
